              <p>I'm a <span class="accent-color">multi-passionate creative</span> figuring out which direction I'm going to head next. I spent some time working in print design and flexed my leadership skills overseeing teams of contractors through multiple projects both large and small. I started freelancing with web design and development sprinkled with some email marketing, and had a short stint creating digital assets for a popular, South Florida based order-ahead food app. I geek out on things related to health, wellness, fitness and self-improvement with a collection of podcasts subscriptions to prove it. I love the outdoors, after living in Florida for a few years I'm really starting to miss the mountains and trees from the West. </p>

                <p>I was born and raised in Utah, but I call California home even though we didn't move till the summer before my junior year of high school. I have four sisters and the five of us couldn't be any more different from each other. Despite that fact, I think I got my love of art and design from two of my older sisters. I would see their art projects and aspire to create something similar one day! Having the opportunity to study under their same art teachers in high school was pretty awesome. </p>

            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                <p>Even though I loved art and thought I would pursue that, my first go around at higher education was at a technical college where I studied Computer Information Technology. I was always either the only, or one of only two girls in class. I coded in Visual Basic, built a walkman (does anyone even know what that is anymore?) and my final project was to build a computer tower from scratch. I didn't turn that experience into a career, but I kicked butt in that course and I'm proud of everything I learned and accomplished! </p>

            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                 <p> I've always loved music! I'm pretty sure I get that from my dad. At every party, gathering, bbq... just a Saturday night at home, there was always music playing. I grew up listening to the music my dad grew up listening to so it's really fun to point out when songs get sampled in newer music. My first concert was an "Oldies Concert" and my first favorite artist was Stevie Wonder. I picked up the piano playing by ear and took lessons for a few years. I was pretty good at it and that is one talent that I wish I would have kept up on!</p>
